## Which aiogram version should I use?

Aiogram 2.x is essentially outdated at this point. While it can still be used, it lacks support for the latest TelegramBotApi versions. Understanding Aiogram 2.x may be necessary to maintain older projects, but aside from that, there's little reason to begin learning it now. It's advisable to start with the most recent version.
